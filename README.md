# RUGR-Occupancy-Analysis
Occupancy analysis of ruffed grouse data across the province of Alberta to determine the best method to estimate their population numbers.

We are comparing the number of samples necessary for naive occupancy to approach p-adjusted occupancy estimates
using the unmarked package, starting with just using one random visit to each site, and then simulating visit data for each location
until the occupancy estimates converge.
